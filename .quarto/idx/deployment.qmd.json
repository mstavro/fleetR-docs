{"title":"Deploying via GitHub Actions","markdown":{"headingText":"Deploying via GitHub Actions","containsRefs":false,"markdown":"We're at the last part. We laugh, we cried, we made some friends along the way - okay, we didn't do any of that. We did make a lot of tables, though. Now all that's left is sharing them with the world.\n\n## Putting into Quarto and Styling\nBefore we talk about GitHub pages, you're going to want to put the pieces we've assembled in the previous chapters into a Quarto document - specifically, the web development pieces that came out of @sec-map-table and @sec-many-tables. I've got an example for you to use [here](https://github.com/mstavro/united-explorer/blob/main/index.qmd).\n\nAnother interject: I neglected to share some styling things to spruce up your dashboard before deployment. I mentioned SCSS rules in @sec-map-table, but here's the full SCSS you might want to have:\n\n```\n$navbar-bg: black;\n$navbar-fg: white;\n\n/*-- scss:rules --*/\n// CSS rules for styling go here\n// Scale pop-up for different displays\nbody .maplibregl-popup {\n    max-width: 80vw !important; // Default for mobile and small screens (<901px)\n    max-height: 70vh !important;\n    z-index: 1200;\n}\n\n// Rule for displays between 901px and 1351px\n@media screen and (min-width: 901px) and (max-width: 1351px) {\n    body .maplibregl-popup {\n        max-width: 60vw !important; // Larger on \"tablet\" and medium desktop displays\n    }\n}\n\n// Rule for large displays (>1351px)\n@media screen and (min-width: 1352px) {\n    body .maplibregl-popup {\n        max-width: 40vw !important; // Smaller on large desktop displays\n    }\n}\n\nbody .maplibregl-popup-content {\n    overflow-x: auto !important;\n    overflow-y: auto !important;\n}\n```\n\nAdditionally, you might want to use a ```_brand.yml``` file mimicking your airline of choice. Here's mine for United:\n\n```\nmeta:\n  name: United Airlines\n  link: https://www.united.com\n    \nlogo: \n  images:\n    united-logo:\n      path: \"https://www.united.com/2500e4e62233fbfe8ac6.unitedLogoNew.svg\"\n      alt: \"United Airlines\"\n  small: united-logo\n  medium: united-logo\n  large: united-logo\n\ncolor:\n  palette:\n    blue: \"#1414D2\"\n  primary: blue\n  secondary: white\n```\n\nFinally, you're probably going to want a ```_quarto.yml``` file for your project. I'll get to that below.\n\n## Setting up GitHub Pages and GitHub Actions {#sec-deployment}\nI guess it's worth talking about the strategies of deployment quickly. Side note that Hadley Wickham has a [book-in-progress on this](https://r-in-production.org/) and you should probably read it, because what I'm about to give you is the cliff-notes version of a workshop based on said book.\n\nBasically, the first step we should think about when we think through deployment is longevity - i.e., managing package versions. We've got three options for this:\n\n1. YOLO: just send it up on GitHub or Posit Connect or whatever with whatever pak pulls\n2. Pack and ship: use rsconnect::manifest(), which works really well with Posit tools and is really elegant and frankly a really good plug for Posit solutions.\n3. Freeze it: use renv to lock everything.\n\nWe're going to use YOLO, because in the workshop it had a cool picture of a guy hang gliding but also because the packages we use are stable enough for present purposes. Moreover, we are also constantly building our app, and pak/GitHub will package lock our builds at the time of compilation. Moreover moreover, it fits with our current approach of using CDNs and connections to online resources whenever we can. I don't recommend this necessarily if you want an app that you're sure won't suffer from a breaking change. The converse of that is your app won't benefit from improvements/new functionality introduced into packages that take effect natively. So your mileage will vary here.\n\nTo continuously integrate and deploy (CI/CD!) our app, we're going to need a few things:\n\n- GitHub Pages\n- A GitHub action to render and deploy our index.qmd to pages\n- A GitHub action to pull the United fleet Google Sheet every so often in case United takes new deliveries (or some planes go inactive)\n\n### GitHub Pages\nI'm assuming you have GitHub initialized. If you don't, start with this in the console while in your project directory:\n\n```usethis::use_github()```\n\nBefore you go any further, remember when we introduced some secrets in @sec-opensky? Yeah, we're probably going to want to tell GitHub about those. It's okay, I don't think GitHub is interested in telling everyone your secrets.[^1] Navigate to your repository, then go to \"Settings\", and go to \"Secrets and Variables.\" You're going to want to add two repository secrets, one called OPENSKY_CLIENT_ID and the other OPENSKY_CLIENT_SECRET, corresponding to your ID and SECRET in your credentials.json/.Renviron from earlier.\n\n![](assets/repo_secrets.png)\n\n:::{.callout}\nReminder that if you change your secret for whatever reason, change it in the repo. Else you'll be stuck frustrated for at least 2-3 hours like me wondering why your deployment isn't working, only to remember that you rotated your secret.\n:::\n[^1]: In fact, there are some limited things GitHub does to prevent you from accidentally leaking a secret, but if you're really determined, then GitHub's not going to be able to stop you.\n\n**And before you go any further again, you're going to likely want a ```_quarto.yml``` file for your project, even if it's just a standalone page/dashboard.** You don't *need* this; you're able to deploy individual sites without a ```_quarto.yml file.``` Speaking from experience, though, the ```_quarto.yml``` file makes your life a bit easier because it enables you to use the Quarto publish workflow:\n\n```\n      - name: Render and Publish\n        uses: quarto-dev/quarto-actions/publish@v2\n        with:\n          target: gh-pages\n        env:\n          OPENSKY_CLIENT_ID: ${{ secrets.OPENSKY_CLIENT_ID }}\n          OPENSKY_CLIENT_SECRET: ${{ secrets.OPENSKY_CLIENT_SECRET }}\n```\n\nIf you're not sure how to set up a ```_quarto.yaml```, in this case it can be as simple as this:\n\n```\nproject:\n  type: website \n\nwebsite:\n  title: \"Posit Table Contest\"\n  favicon: https://www.united.com/2500e4e62233fbfe8ac6.unitedLogoNew.svg\n```\n\nYou can then set up pages:\n\n```usethis::use_github_pages()```\n\nYour Quarto doc will render for its initial deployment to pages. If you're overly eager like me, you might've changed your \"Pages\" setting to \"Deploy from GitHub Actions\" - **change it back** to \"Deploy from a branch\" if that's the case, and make sure it's deploying from \"gh-pages\" (unless you changed the defaults set by ```use_github_pages()```).\n\nAfter the initial render, you should have your first deployment! Hooray! But how do we get it to continuously deploy?","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","output-file":"deployment.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
