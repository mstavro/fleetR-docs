This book documents my entry for Posit's 2025 Table Contest, the ***Unofficial United Mainline Fleet Tracker.***

### The Method Behind the Madness
> Why did you do it *that* way?

In my limited years of experience on this Earth (23 of them and some change), I find that thinking about things is hard.[^1] Writing about them is perhaps even harder. I can't help my mental tendencies to make simplifying assumptions about the world and hope that you, dear reader, will magically share those same assumptions.

But I'm going to try anyway. To that end, this documentation should leave you with these two things:

1. An understanding of how to reproduce my entry with the provided code;
2. An understanding of the state of mind when embarking on a project like this;

I think that point two is just as important as point one because, if you're like me, you'll venture on a project like this one and have several "what the %@$&*! is going on?" moments along the way. Which is great, and a little daunting. Point being that seeing someone else navigate these decision points is often helpful for understanding how to navigate your own projects (I hope, again with the assumptions).

So hopefully this will read like a little story, we'll journey through it together and have more or less an understanding of how to embark on a *"software"* project.[^2]
